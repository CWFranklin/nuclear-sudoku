# Nuclear Sudoku

Nuclear Sudoku is an original idea conceived by [Phil Hazelton](https://github.com/philhaz) and was built inside a day with the assistance of [Chris Franklin](https://github.com/CWFranklin) during the September 2013 hackbmth event. A case study was published by Jon Ginn of Open Device Lab Bournemouth and can be found [here](https://odl.wearebase.com/blog/case-study-nuclear-sudoku/).

This is near-enough the original version (with minor improvements made since the hackbmth event), and with Phil's generous permission, Nuclear Sudoku is hosted here under the MIT license.
